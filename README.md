## COMPETITIONS  

### Feedback Prize, English Language Learning (Top 21% - 573 out of 2740)

The goal of this competition is to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). Utilizing a dataset of essays written by ELLs will help to develop proficiency models that better support all students.  

Best strategy: Ensemble 10 BERT-based transformers models using Pytorch.
  
### Open Problems, Multimodal Single-Cell Integration (Top 16% - 195 out of 1220)

The goal of this competition is to predict how DNA, RNA, and protein measurements co-vary in single cells as bone marrow stem cells develop into more mature blood cells.

Best strategy: Use Keras and TensorFlow for model training and tuning.


## Python projects

### COMO VOTA? (How do you vote?)

#### Overview
"Como Vota?" is an application designed to enhance transparency in the political arena of Brazil by providing insights into parliamentary activities. This tool aims to offer a clearer understanding of voting behaviors and parliamentary decisions, addressing the lack of transparency in Brazilian politics.

#### Technical Approach
- **Web Application Development:** Developed using Streamlit, a library that simplifies creating and hosting web applications.
- **API Integration:** Utilized APIs to fetch parliamentary data, requiring skills in working with API endpoints and handling JSON data structures.
- **Data Visualization:** Implemented visualizations using Plotly and Seaborn to represent the data effectively and engagingly.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - **Cloud Hosting:** Planning to host the application and its data processing methods in the cloud to facilitate automatic updates.
  - **Community Engagement:** Intends to share the datasets on the Kaggle platform, enabling the community to conduct their analyses.
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Plans to incorporate NLP to analyze parliamentary speeches and assess congresspeople's interests and focus areas.

#### Repository
The source code and additional resources can be found in the GitHub repository: [Como Vota on GitHub](https://github.com/gabrielbchacon/como_vota_st)

#### Conclusion
The "Como Vota?" application bridges the gap between citizens and their representatives by providing a platform that demystifies parliamentary proceedings. By leveraging modern web technologies and data analytics, this project serves as a pivotal tool for fostering political awareness and engagement in Brazil.

### FOREST FIRE AREA PREDICTION IN NORTHEAST PORTUGAL 
(https://github.com/gabrielbchacon/my_data_portfolio/blob/9433bcf4e820628527b7caa3fa533fd43e0988e3/Previs%C3%A3o_area_queimada_em_incendios_florestais.ipynb)

#### Overview
This project aims to predict the burned area in forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal using meteorological and other relevant factors. The study leverages data from the "Forest Fires" dataset available at the UCI repository, encompassing features like spatial coordinates, FWI indices, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

#### Technical Approach
- **Data Import & Preparation:** Utilized `ucimlrepo` library for data import and performed initial data cleaning including One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables (months and days).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted using histograms, boxplots, correlation matrices, and scatter plots to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Modeling:** Applied a variety of machine learning and deep learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and Neural Networks. Models were evaluated based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

#### Key Insights
- **Data Transformation:** Normalization and encoding significantly influenced the modeling accuracy.
- **Model Diversity:** Exploring different models highlighted the varying effectiveness in predicting the burned area, guiding the selection of the most appropriate models.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Crucial for making informed modeling decisions, particularly in variable selection and outlier detection.

#### Conclusion
This project underscores the importance of meticulous data preparation and the strategic use of diverse modeling techniques to predict areas affected by forest fires. The results and methodologies discussed could serve as a reference for similar predictive modeling challenges.
