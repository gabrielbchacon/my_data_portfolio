## COMPETITIONS  

### Feedback Prize, English Language Learning (Top 21% - 573 out of 2740)

The goal of this competition is to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). Utilizing a dataset of essays written by ELLs will help to develop proficiency models that better support all students.  

Best strategy: Ensemble 10 BERT-based transformers models using Pytorch.
  
### Open Problems, Multimodal Single-Cell Integration (Top 16% - 195 out of 1220)

The goal of this competition is to predict how DNA, RNA, and protein measurements co-vary in single cells as bone marrow stem cells develop into more mature blood cells.

Best strategy: Use Keras and TensorFlow for model training and tuning.


## Projects

### Python Development

COMO VOTA? (How do you vote?) #PythonDev #APICosuming #LargeDatasets

Overview
"Como Vota?" is an application designed to enhance transparency in the political arena of Brazil by providing insights into parliamentary activities. This tool aims to offer a clearer understanding of voting behaviors and parliamentary decisions, addressing the lack of transparency in Brazilian politics.

### Machine Learning
#### Regression
FOREST FIRE AREA PREDICTION IN NORTHEAST PORTUGAL #MachineLearning #PredictiveModel #DataAnalysis

Overview
This project aims to predict the burned area in forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal using meteorological and other relevant factors. The study leverages data from the "Forest Fires" dataset available at the UCI repository, encompassing features like spatial coordinates, FWI indices, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

#### Clustering
CHURN PREDITIVE CLUSTER ANALYTICS #MachineLearning #Clustering #DataAnalysis

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecommunications company through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering techniques. After understanding the dataset's structure and conducting EDA to identify patterns and relationships, including factors like service subscriptions, contract length, and demographics, clustering algorithms like K-means and DBSCAN are applied to segment customers based on churn likelihood. Insights from EDA inform actionable strategies to mitigate churn, while cluster analysis helps identify high-risk groups, allowing for personalized retention initiatives tailored to specific customer profiles, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing churn rates.

CLUSTERING NATIONS BY SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS #MachineLearning #Clustering #DataAnalysis #DataVizualization

This project employs unsupervised learning techniques, particularly K-means clustering, to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health factors. It identifies three distinct clusters (A, B, and C) representing varying levels of economic development and health metrics. Notably, the correlation between economic growth and improvements in net income per person is highlighted. While K-means effectively separates countries based on analyzed factors, it may oversimplify complex socio-economic contexts, leading to diverse countries being grouped together. This underscores the importance of considering additional factors such as political influence and economic context for more nuanced aid allocation decisions.
