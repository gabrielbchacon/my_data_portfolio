# Welcome to my Data Portfolio 


## First, let me introduce myself: 

I'm Gabriel Chacon. I have a bachelor's degree in Economics with Data Science Specialization. I have been working in Startups in several stages of growth, banks and retail market focused on business areas. I'm an enthusiast of Data Science, my focus is to be a bridge between core business areas and Data. I have Python skills, Statistics models, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization tools. I'm also a tech content creator, you can check my Youtube channel called (Chá con Tech), it is in Portuguese, and it teaches Python and Data-related topics.

## COMPETITIONS  

### Feedback Prize, English Language Learning (Top 21% - 573 out of 2740)

The goal of this competition is to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). Utilizing a dataset of essays written by ELLs will help to develop proficiency models that better supports all students.  

Best strategy: Ensemble of 10 BERT based transformers models using Pytorch.
  
### Open Problems, Multimodal Single-Cell Integration (Top 16% - 195 out of 1220)

The goal of this competition is to predict how DNA, RNA, and protein measurements co-vary in single cells as bone marrow stem cells develop into more mature blood cells.

Best strategy: Use Keras and TensorFlow for model training and tuning.


## Python Development

### COMO VOTA? 

I decided to build an application called "Como Vota" (How do you vote?) which allows people to have a better understanding of the parliamentary activity, giving a level of transparency I believe is missing in the political scenario in Brazil. 

I built it using a lib called Streamlit that allows creating a web app and host in a very easy way. It was required to know how to work with API and build objects to extract and dump the JSON files. Also some data vizualization tools such as plot using Plotly and Seaborn. 

Further, I will host all those methods in the cloud to automate the process of updating data. I'm also planning to share those bases on the Kaggle platform to allow the community to analyze this dataset. I also have plans to work with NLP to analyze the speech and give an overview of the congresspeople's interests.
