# Welcome to my Data Portfolio 


## First, let me introduce myself: 

I'm Gabriel Chacon. I have a bachelor's degree in Economics with Data Science Specialization. I have been working in Startups in several stages of growth, banks and retail market focused on business areas. I'm an enthusiast of Data Science, my focus is to be a bridge between core business areas and Data. I have Python skills, Statistics models, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization tools. I'm also a tech content creator, you can check my Youtube channel called (Ch√° con Tech), it is in Portuguese, and it teaches Python and Data-related topics.

## Portfolio
I have guided my career to be 100% data-oriented and focused on the Data Science skill set. It is, of course, a challenge because Data Science is a such huge and complex field requiring a skill set very diverse. So I'll divide this portfolio into 3 main topics:

 - Data Analysis
 - Models Creation
 - App Development

### Models Creation


#### Clustering 

I wrapped all the clustering projects I worked on in the following folder: 
https://github.com/gabrielbchacon/Clustering

My highlight is the notebook called *[clustering-the-countries-by-k-means.ipynb](https://github.com/gabrielbchacon/Clustering/blob/main/clustering-the-countries-by-k-means.ipynb)* where I used k-means approach to cluster countries based on social-economic metrics. 

#### Classification

I wrapped all the clustering projects I worked on in the following folder: 
https://github.com/gabrielbchacon/classification_models

The main project was the notebook called [*nlp-model-to-predict-hate-speech.ipynb*](https://github.com/gabrielbchacon/classification_models/blob/main/nlp-model-to-predict-hate-speech.ipynb) where the challenge was classifying tweet that was considered hate speech. It requires NLP skill set to build a bag of words array to train the data set. 


### App Development


I also have an interest in app development. I got courses about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and ReactJs, but my focus is Python.

 I decided to build an application called "Como Vota" (How do you vote?) which allows people to have a better understanding of the parliamentary activity, giving a level of transparency I believe is missing in the political scenario in Brazil. 

I built it using a lib called Streamlit that allows creating a web app and host in a very easy way. It was required to know how to work with API and build objects to extract and dump the JSON files. Also some data vizualization tools such as plot using Plotly and Seaborn. 

 Further, I will host all those methods in the cloud to automate the process of updating data. I'm also planning to share those bases on the Kaggle platform to allow the community to analyze this dataset. I also have plans to work with NLP to analyze the speech and give an overview of the congresspeople's interests.
